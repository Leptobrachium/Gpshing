# Cane Toad Acoustic Classifier: A Free Tool for Monitoring Invasive Cane Toads in Australia

---

## Overview

This repository provides a freely available and user-friendly acoustic classifier for detecting the invasive cane toad (*Rhinella marina*) across Australia. The classifier was developed using BirdNET, a deep-learning-based species recognition algorithm, and trained on a large-scale passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) dataset from the Australian Acoustic Observatory (A2O).

## Workflow

The classifier development follows a structured workflow:

### **1. Data Generation**
- Cane toad calls were extracted from A2O data.
- Training and testing datasets were generated using template detection methods.

### **2. Classifier Training**
- The training dataset was used to develop a custom classifier in BirdNET.
- Additional non-target vocalizations and background noise were included to enhance performance.

### **3. Preliminary Assessment**
- The trained classifier was tested on a subset of audio data from selected A2O sites.
- Performance metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy were evaluated across multiple temporal scales.

### **4. Audio Analysis**
- The classifier was applied to the full dataset.
- Probabilistic thresholds were computed to assess detection confidence.

### **5. Classifier Performance Assessment**
- Validation was conducted using manual verification of randomly sampled detections.

### **6. Detections Optimization (Optional)**
- Aggregated time-series features (ATF) were used to refine detection outputs.
- A conditional inference tree (CIT) model was applied to improve precision and recall.
